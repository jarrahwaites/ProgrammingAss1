          <p>
My name is Jarrah Waites. I am a 23-year-old female from Melbourne Victoria. I unfortunately only speak English. I am so jealous of people who are bilingual or trilingual. One of my goals is to learn Auslan as I believe it is a language, we should all be taught.  When sign language is learnt It promotes better awareness for the deaf and hard hearing community. 
<h1></h1>
I have a Batchelor degree in health but hope to expand my knowledge through this introduction of IT.
<h2></h2>
A fact about myself may not know is that I am beyond consumed with watching gymnastics. Although I have no experience in the sport whatsoever, I thoroughly enjoy watching the 90 second floor routine with the anxiousness of if Simone Biles will land her triple double.

          <h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>Interest In IT</b></h5>
          
          <p>From an early age I saw interest in Information Technology (IT) and how it impacted and improved my and others lives around me.  It amazed me how new developments such as the internet, USB and even smart phones quickly became the norm making us reflect how we ever lived without this technology. I was not even in primary school when I would beg my mother and father to jump on their computer to play games. Later in my schooling years 11 and 12 VCE for English we would have to read upwards of two or three novels a year. I was never a great reader, so I opted to audible. By having an alternative, it allowed me to think deeply that education, social interaction and life didn’t have to be as black and white as we all originally thought. Opening my real passion into IT. 
From this moment on I began to get heavy involved in teaching myself anything useful in IT. If a family member or friend had an issue with anything IT I would make it my mission to do as much research as possible to fix the problem with frequently succeeding. 
<h6 class="w3-opacity"><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT</b></h6>

I didn’t have a gap year after my year 12 studies, and I will admit this is one of my biggest regrets to date. I went straight into a Batchelor degree in Health Science- Public Health at Latrobe University. After finishing the degree, I struggled to find a job that really stood out to me. After looking at endless job applications I came to the harsh realisation that I just completed a degree which I had minimal interest in.  
After finishing this degree in early November 2019 unlike my peers who were obtaining job proposals or applying for masters, I decided to take a gap year.  This is how I rediscovered my interest in IT. 
I looked at both Latrobe University and RMIT to commence studies, but I loved how RMIT offered a two-subject introduction to Batchelor Of IT. The two subject introductions will allow to slowly be reintroduced to the world of academia. 
<h6 class="w3-opacity"><b>What do you expect to learn in IT?</b></h6>

I expect to learn essential skills for IT that will allow me to work in web and mobile computing, security and cloud computing or system administration. When enrolling into this degree these were three specialisations that stood out to me which was the motivation to enrol.

          <h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>Ideal Job</b></h5>
          
          <p>
          <a href=" https://www.seek.com.au/job/50523099?type=standard#searchRequestToken=29178899-3a2b-40d4-b6a0-5b91bca9e92c">Seek Job listing/Lead software developer</a>
         
<h6 class="w3-opacity"><b></b></h6>
This position is a software developer leader position that will expect the adequate candidate to execute large projects and overview a team. This position will expect the applicant to have exceptional mentoring skills to effectively improve and guide the team to frequently improve. Software development includes designing, researching and managing new software programs. This can also include writing and implementing code.
This position particularly incorporates working closely with other developers to essentially provide an end result.
This position is appealing to me as I have always considered myself a leader. It is something that comes extremely natural to me. After reading this job application it really resonated with me. My goal in this degree is to end up working in software design and I can imagine myself eventually working in the space.

To be an adequate candidate for this position the requirements would be 
<h1></h1>
-	Batchelor in information technology and or software engineering
<h2></h2>
-	3+ years’ experience in software development 
<h3></h3>
-	Demonstrated knowledge in front end, API, CMS websites, infrastructure/Dev-ops
<h4></h4>
I currently have no professional experience in the IT industry, although within this position I have experience mentoring. Although through captainship at school and within high level sport I know how to lead by example, keep others motivated, give constructive criticism and have a challenging conversation when its necessary.  I believe these are skills that can’t be taught yet have to a degree come naturally.
<h5></h5>
To obtain the qualification to be a successful candidate for this position I would need to complete a Batchelor of IT or Computer Science and an additional degree of Batchelor of Software engineering or a Diploma in software. I would need sufficient work experience with a minimum requirement of 3+ years.
